                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                    far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been 
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                    of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                     to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
                     wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond 
                     detection, like spit in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the 
                    beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, 
                    looked right.

                    with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
                    Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time 
                    — so-called <a class="blue">gravitational waves </a>— the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                    violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
                     They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, 
                     that Dr. Guth was correct.

                <div class="text1">THE UNIVERSE  is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</div>
                <div class="text2">NOT ENOUGH TIME  The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</div>
                <div class="text3">DISTANT COFFEE  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled. </div>
                <div class="text4">COFFEE EVERYWHERE  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</div>
                <div class="text5">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME  There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</div>
                <div class="text6">INFLATION  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</div>
                <div class="text7">FLUCTUATION  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</div>
                <div class="text8">EXPANSION  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</div>
