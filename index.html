                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                        son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                        far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mainText">
                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been 
                        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                        special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                        of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mainText">
                        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                         to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
                         wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond 
                         detection, like spit in the ocean.

                    <p class="mainText">
                        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the 
                        beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, 
                        looked right.

                        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a class="blue">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> 
                        with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
                        Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time 
                        — so-called <a class="blue">gravitational waves </a>— the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                        violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
                         They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, 
                         that Dr. Guth was correct.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mainText">
                        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered 
                        whether it could ever be proved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mainText">
                        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
                         of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
                         and space and energy to science and speculation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mainText">
                        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
                         its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, 
                         architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
                         of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the 
                        reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would 
                        be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general
                         relativity, should ruffle space-time.

                        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, 
                        said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”

                    <p class="mainText">
                        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in 
                        gravitational waves.”

                        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that 
                        permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
                         surface of the sun.

                    Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                <div class="text2"> <span class="inflationHeadText">THE UNIVERSE</span>  &nbsp;  is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</div>
                <div class="text3"><span class="inflationHeadText">NOT ENOUGH TIME </span>  &nbsp; The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</div>
                <div class="text4"><span class="inflationHeadText">DISTANT COFFEE </span>  &nbsp; At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled. </div>
                <div class="text5"><span class="inflationHeadText">COFFEE EVERYWHERE </span>  &nbsp; Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</div>
                <div class="text6"><span class="inflationHeadText">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME </span>  &nbsp; There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold.

                <div class="text7"><span class="inflationHeadText">INFLATION </span>  &nbsp; solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light.

                <div class="text8"><span class="inflationHeadText">FLUCTUATION </span> &nbsp; Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe.

                         the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and

                        Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the
                         new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the 
                         European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.

                        Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were 
                        discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel 
                        Prize.

                    <p class="mainText">
                        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of 
                        Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where 
                        the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of 
                        Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

                        “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has 
                        been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

                    In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the 
                    light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, 
                    squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of 
                    polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
                     little arrows going in spirals.

                <p class="mainText">
                    Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the 
                    microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

                    The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard 
                    supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the 
                    breakthrough

                    <strong>A Special Time</strong>
                </p>
                <p class=" mainText ">
                    The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo
                     Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and 
                    weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a 
                    single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology 
                    of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another 
                    splitting away.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    That was where Dr. Guth came in.

                <p class="mainText">
                    Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until
                     it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself 
                    would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe
                     would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created,
                      the harder it pushed apart.

                    What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a 
                    submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal 
                    cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions 
                    of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, 
                    “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”

                <p class="mainText">
                    Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest
                     that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey 
                     expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a 
                     concept known as the multiverse.

                    We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases 
                    everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, 
                    forever out of our view.
