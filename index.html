                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                    far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been 
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                    of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                     to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
                     wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond 
                     detection, like spit in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the 
                    beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, 
                    looked right.

                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a class="blue">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> 
                    with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
                    Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time 
                    — so-called <a class="blue">gravitational waves </a>— the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                    violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
                     They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, 
                     that Dr. Guth was correct.
